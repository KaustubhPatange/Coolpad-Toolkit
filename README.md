# Some Instructions :
1. To Use This Tool from this source you need to Compile it into exe and then use it otherwise some call script will not function well insense script calling classes would not work.
2. For Newbies to download source click on the Clone or Download button and then Download as ZIP, in android make sure you switch to desktop version to do the same process.
3. Please install the ToolKit to the root folder on your PC if possible. For example C:\Coolpad_Toolkit or D:\Coolpad_Toolkit

If you install it to a folder with brackets or special characters in the filename such 
as C:\Program Files (x86)\ then it may cause certain processes in the ToolKit to fail.

If you already have the Toolkit installed and want to update it, just open Toolkit.exe
and then enter key "CH" to check for updates. If updates are available it will be
automatically downloaded.

There have been reports of the Toolkit not working properly if the User Account
name is very long or contains special characters so be aware if you have problems.
